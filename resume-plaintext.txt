Hi! I'm a quality-driven, pragmatic and highly motivated software engineer.
I’m an expert on the modern frontend web and I have significant full stack experience.
I have product management and technical writing skills from a past life that help
me to communicate tough concepts to diverse audiences and to understand the design
of the products I develop.  I'm looking for a team that doesn't compromise on
quality—in its product or its code. I love to teach and to learn, I contribute
to open source, and I can jump really, really high.


Skills
======

Modern Javascript, HTML, and CSS. UI/UX design.
React w/ Redux, Backbone w/ Marionette, AngularJS.
Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, Redis.
Clojure, re-frame, core.async.
Linux and MacOS, git, bash.
And more!


Work Experience
===============

Veritone
--------
The leading cloud-based Artificial Intelligence media tech company.
Dec 2016 to present

Lead Software Engineer

+ Led frontend development for a new developer-facing web product, built with
Javascript, React, and Redux, which has remained substantially bug-free for over
a year of continued development. Successfully handed off the project after launch
to a new team who became productive with very little ramp-up.

+ Introduced modern frontend tools and techniques which have spread widely through
the company and led directly to an all-hands effort writing all new features in
React, despite heavy initial skepticism from the existing dev team and management.
I continue to hold primary responsibility for frontend coding standards and
architecture in the new stack.

+ Conceived, architected and built a set of eight open-source packages implementing
our common UI/UX and frontend business logic, primarily in React and Redux, which
have become the core of all new frontend development for both our internal team
and for our integration partners. Successfully introduced nearly a dozen developers
to the codebase and helped them become productive quickly, while maintaining high
standards for code and functionality.

+ As a lead software engineer, focused heavily on mentorship with the simple intent
of helping each person on my team write the best possible code.


Bottlenose, Inc.
----------------
Developer of software for next-generation data discovery.
2015 to  2016
(team acquired by Veritone)

Lead Software Engineer

+ Led a team of engineers developing the frontend of the company's new data analysis
and discovery platform, built with Javascript, React and Redux. Met tight startup
deadlines, delivering a product that feels and works great from a user’s perspective
and that’s a joy to work in as a developer.

+ Added major new features to the company’s legacy data analysis platform, on both
frontend and backend, including the main navigation and data-selection component,
user-configurable dashboards, an admin interface, and several detailed reporting
views. Used Backbone and Marionette to build the frontend, and Node.js with MongoDB
and Express for the backend.


Honey
-----
Creates tools that automate deal-finding and product discovery on the web.
2014 to  2015

Software Engineer

+ Built features and squashed bugs in the company’s web, browser extension and iOS
products across front- and backend, in CoffeeScript, Javascript, Swift, PHP, and
HTML5/CSS3.

+ Collaborated to design the frontend of a new web product, focusing on ease of
development and maintenance, isomorphic/universal rendering for SEO and fast page
loads, and scalability.


Currie Tech
-----------
Hybrid-electric bicycle manufacturer.
2008–2014

Product Manager  2010–2014

+ Managed the IZIP, eFlow, and eZip lines of electric bicycles (about 12 distinct
models), working closely with the software engineering team to develop and test
the software programmed into every bike sold, both remotely and on-site in China
and Taiwan.
