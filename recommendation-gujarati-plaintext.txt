Mitch is the rock upon which our enterprise intelligence product at Bottlenose
was built. In terms of pure engineering talent, Mitch is one of the best I’ve
worked with. His ability to relentlessly produce quality code in incredibly
small amounts of time is remarkable. It enabled us to not only build an exceptional
product quickly, but to continue to ship features and improvements at a rapid
frequency and with uncommon regularity.

Mitch’s unique talent is paired with an admirable focus and dedication to his craft.
The engineering team benefitted immensely from his experience and ability to
understand business issues and goals. As a PM I know how lucky I’ve been to
have Mitch to rely on.
