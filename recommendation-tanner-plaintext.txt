Mitch was easily one of the best engineers I've worked with. His willingness to
mentor others and dedication to best practices not only helped me become a better
developer, but also led to the creation of an efficient & modular platform. No
task was too difficult for Mitch, often tackling complicated features while still
giving up some time to provide quality feedback during code reviews. He has a
knack for breaking down complex features into easy to understand subproblems,
which is invaluable when leading a team.
